# Falcon512 Rust

This crate provides an efficient, constant-time implementation of key cryptographic primitives for the Falcon512 signature scheme, as well as supporting modular arithmetic and encoding/decoding routines. The code is tailored for use in lattice-based cryptography and digital signatures, with a focus on performances.
Implementation allows to be run on Solana (tested despite current max transaction size limit) and potentially other Rust compatible chains (untested).

## Features

- **Keccak/SHAKE256 permutation core**: Efficiently processes the state for SHAKE-based hash functions.
- **Montgomery modular arithmetic**: Constant-time multiplication, addition, subtraction, and utility functions for cryptographic fields.
- **Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)**: Fast polynomial transforms for use in lattice-based cryptography.
- **Signature verification and encoding**: Utilities for signature checking and public key handling, including NTT format conversion.
- **To be implemented**: 
  - `keygen`
  - `sign`

## Highlights

### Cryptographic Hashing

- `process_block(shake_ctx: &mut [u64; 26])`
    - Runs the Keccak permutation on a SHAKE256 context, mutating the state in-place.
- `shake_inject(shake_ctx: &mut [u64; 26], input: &[u8])`
    - Absorbs input bytes into the SHAKE256 context. Not intended for consecutive calls.
- `shake_flip(shake_ctx: &mut [u64; 26])`
    - Switches the SHAKE256 context to output mode, after which extraction can occur.
- `shake_extract(shake_ctx: &mut [u64; 26]) -> [u64; SHAKE_EXTRACT_OUT_CAPACITY_WORDS]`
    - Extracts ("squeezes") output from the SHAKE256 context in 8-byte chunks.

### Modular Arithmetic (Montgomery)

- `mq_montymul(a: u16, b: u16) -> u16`
    - Performs constant-time Montgomery modular multiplication with the field modulus `Q`.
- `mq_add(a: u16, b: u16) -> u16`
    - Modular addition: returns `(a + b) mod Q`.
- `mq_sub(a: u16, b: u16) -> u16`
    - Modular subtraction: returns `(a - b) mod Q`.

### Number Theoretic Transform

- `mq_ntt(p: &mut [u16; N])`
    - Performs an in-place Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 NTT utilizing Montgomery multiplication for speed and security. Used for fast polynomial operations in Falcon.
- `mq_intt(p: &mut [u16; N])`
    - Performs an in-place Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 inverse NTT utilizing Montgomery multiplication for speed and security. Used for fast polynomial operations in Falcon.

### Encoding, Decoding, and Verification

- `mq_decode(x: &mut [u16; N], input: &[u8; FALCON_PK_SIZE], offset: usize) -> usize`
    - Decodes a Falcon public key from a byte slice into polynomial coefficients.
- `pk_to_ntt_fmt(pk: &[u8; FALCON_PK_SIZE]) -> [u16; N]`
    - Converts and validates a public key, returning it in NTT format (panics on invalid input).
- `verify(nonce_msg: &[u8], sig: &[u8], pk_ntt_fmt: &[u16; N]) -> bool`
    - Verifies a Falcon signature for the given nonce + message and public key.

## Usage

Include the crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
falcon512_rs = "0.1"
```

Example for signature verification:

```rust
let pk_ntt = pk_to_ntt_fmt(&pk);
let valid = verify(&nonce_msg, &sig, &pk_ntt);

assert!(valid);
```

## Security Notes

- All cryptographic routines are implemented to be constant-time, but you should always audit and test for your specific target and platform.
- Never use these primitives without understanding the Falcon signature scheme and its parameterization.
- This crate assumes valid inputs and panics on malformed data where appropriate.
- This code use unchecked maths and unsafe pointer accesses & updates (on bounded indexes).
