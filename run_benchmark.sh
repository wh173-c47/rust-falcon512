# The command to run a specific example in release mode with our custom features.
#
# --package falcon512_rs : Specifies which package to build (useful in a workspace).
# --example custom_bench : Tells Cargo to build and run the file in `examples/custom_bench.rs`.
# --release              : Crucial for performance. Compiles with full optimizations.
# --features bench       : Enables the `bench` feature to track memory allocations.
# -- -q                   : (Optional) The '-q' is passed to the final binary to make it less verbose.
#                          You can remove this if your program doesn't use it.
